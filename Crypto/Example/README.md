# Describe Your Though Processes

Give a quick primer on what started you on the journey, you can include what did and what didn't work. Any grand ideas or existing knowledge that lead you to the eventual solution. 

- [ ] You can include your goals.
- [ ] What worked. 
- [ ] Where your knowledge gaps were. 
- [ ] What you learned.

### 1. First Heading 

Keep it organized by putting the various phases of your solution under headings and sub-headings. 

[Mind your markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/) it dramatically improves the professionalism of your write up.

VSCode extensions like Markdown All in One(MDAIO) can really help with writing a markdown document.

# Move on to your main exploit or solutions here. 

### 1. Structure this the same as above

```bash
$ the triple backticks allow you to "fence" code blocks. 
$ As well as tell MD what language it should highlight as.
$ Remember, images, scripts, and commands!
```

#### 1.1 It helps make things easy to follow.
